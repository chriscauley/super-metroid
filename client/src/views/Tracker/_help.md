## Manual Tracker Instructions

All settings/progress are saved in local storage. Use trash can to reset progress.


### Settings

Click the gear button at the far right to view the settings:

* Split: This is the only non-cosmetic settings. This will hide all items not matching the split.
* Warp lines: "legacy" will use the same line colors as the current varia.run site. "area" will draw two lines between each connected warp point. The color and style of the lines indicates which area the line is connected too (eg crater is solid+pink while red brinstar is dashed+green).
* Show item counts: show/hide the list of items in each area in the top right
* large items, large warps: double the size of the click targets


### Keyboard shortcuts

* `cx`: clear all items in area c (crater). If all items are already cleared, reset all items in crater. (see area hotkeys for full list of area letters)
* `g1`: Click the g1 warp (green brinstar elevator)
* `g1c5`: connect warps c5 (left of morph) and g1 (green brinstar elevator). If already connected it will disconnect the two. If either warp is connected to a different warp, command is ignored.
* `ctrl+z`: undo
* `ctrl+shift+z`: redo


### Area hotkeys

I'll make these customizeable eventually but for now:

* Boss doors: boss doors in are always numbered 9. Boss doors out are always numbered 0.
* Other warp doors: I numbered these starting with 1 in the way I felt was most intuitive (left-to-right, top-to-bottom)
* Areas: All areas use their first letter except where there was a confilict (croc, wrecked ship)
* `C` - Crater
* `S` - wrecked Ship
* `T` - Tourian
* `G` - Green Brinstar
* `R` - Red Brinstar
* `K` - Kraids Lair
* `W` - West Maridia
* `E` - East Maridia
* `O` - crOcomires Lair
* `U` - Upper Norfair
* `L` - Lower Norfair
