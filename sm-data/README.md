# sm-data

Shared data library for my super-metroid projects. Find me on discord @badatmetroid if you want to use this. This is in no way related to [sm-json-data](https://github.com/vg-json-data/sm-json-data) which is a more complete description of the game and this repo is focused on making ui components for the VARIA randomizer and other SM sites.
